## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="nzhao.jpeg">

I am an associate professor of economics at the Research Institute of Economics and Management (RIEM), Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE) in Chengdu, China. 

My research focuses on labor economics, empirical IO, and applied microeconomics. In particular, I have a passion for applied research intergrating solid economic theory with empirical evidence using rigorous econometric analysis.
